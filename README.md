# My Source code

list :

 * the problem solving code of [Dovelet](http://dovelet.com) Problems (using C, C++)
 * the game programming code of Duelcgi(Simulator of Yu-Gi-Oh) Game (using Perl, ruby)
 * the PHP-iOS application of our team(nine-spoons, the club of application (using php)
 * the algorithm test system(in sophomore database project) (using php)
 * the algorithm test sites(Incomplete) (using python)
 

## the problem solving code of [Dovelet](http://dovelet.com) Problems
dovelet is one of the most algorithm online judge(like a [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/), [BOJ](http://acmicpc.net), [Algospot](https://algospot.com/), etc). 

I just tried to solve some problems. then, my id([unicode](http://59.23.113.171/nocrawl/usts.php?uid=Unicode)) was the 56th people in the Dovelet User!


## the game programming code of Duelcgi Game
It is simple simulator in the Yugioh. I have downloaded the code to 6th grade(Elementary School). and developed until 2012~2013. I added so many system (Xyz, Synchro, etc...) But I stoped the developing this code. 

## the PHP-iOS application of our team
It is simple PHP-iOS application(My side is php, other team member side is iOS.). It just save the Application's XML files. and, it shows the mobile page if our application is android application.

## the algorithm test system
Using Python-flask, Bootstrap, etc.

## the algorithm test sites
it is my incomplete project. I made it in one day to use [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/). so i can not remember this application :)
